# weather_check
[UPDATE SWITCHED TO Tkinter Based GUI APP]

This python program is checking the local weather in F. The program will use python file  and uses  tkinker to create a GUI where the user will get weather information on the app . In the  app user can search a city and will give the user current weather info with icon of the weather and other details of the weather. The program will use the OpenWeathermap API to get its data. For this particular Python code have to  import tkinter, pillow, requests and ttkbootstrap libaries will be used in order to run the app.


Majority of the program was inspired by this code and I have added some new weather realted returns plus also added weather check based on water condition
which checks all the cities of each country and returns the country that match that weather. For example, in the second search box user can search "Thunderstorm" and the function will check all the cities that will have thunderstorms and it will list those countries.
